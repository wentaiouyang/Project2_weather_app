# Project2 Weather App

项目描述
项目名称：Weather Forest Application

The coding exercise we’d like to work on is building an app where you can input a city name to show the current weather in that city area and the forecast for the upcoming 3 days. You may use www.weatherapi.com, which provides a free API to query weather data. It does require signing up to generate an API key but there is an - https://www.weatherapi.com/api-explorer.aspx - that makes it easy to check the response.

You are free to use any frontend libraries to build this web application. Once you have built the application please send the code back to us in a .zip file (without any modules that can be fetched from the internet) so that we can clone the repository and check its functionality locally on our machine. Please provide some instructions on how to run it locally in the readme. Feel free to comment on the readme any design decisions or assumptions that were made while you built this application.

We will spend some time discussing your solution during the programming interview. Please treat this task like a feature you would build as an engineer using developer best practices and deploy in a production ready state.

Please ensure add some unit test & e2e test if possible.
